# Brainfuck Interpreter

## Overview
This repository contains a Brainfuck interpreter written in C. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalistic design.

## Features
- **Brainfuck Interpreter**: The `brainfuck.c` file is a Brainfuck interpreter that can compile and execute Brainfuck code.
- **Makefile for Easy Compilation**: Includes a Makefile for straightforward compilation and installation on Unix-like systems.

## Compilation and Installation
- To compile the interpreter, run:
  ```
  make
  ```
- To install the interpreter (Linux systems only):
  ```
  sudo make install
  ```
- To uninstall:
  ```
  sudo make uninstall
  ```

## Usage
After compilation, you can use the interpreter to run Brainfuck code. The usage depends on whether you installed it or not. If installed, you can run it directly from the command line. Otherwise, use the compiled executable.

## Limitations
- The installation script in the Makefile is currently only supported on Linux systems.
- The interpreter follows the standard Brainfuck language specifications. Any non-standard extensions are not supported.
